# Corewar ðŸ‘¾
The final project of the Algorithm-branch at Hive Helsinki.  

The project consists of three parts:  
- Virtual Machine   
  * The Game itself, a platform for the champions to battle.  
- Assembler  
  * Takes the champion's raw information and commands, and transforms it to asssembly language for the Virtual Machine to understand it.  
- The Champion  
  * an AI player in the corewar-game, has a name, comment and commands.  
  
The whole project had to be done according to Hive's Norminette; a set of rules that restrict and improve the way we code.  

We allocated [Pavel](https://github.com/pavel-arkharov) and [Marius](https://github.com/Sickology101) to work on the Assembler, and [Ian](https://github.com/IanGaplichnik) and [Miro](https://github.com/MiroTissari) to work on the Virtual Machine.
