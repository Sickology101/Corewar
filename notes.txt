sti (0b) apparently writes the value of r6(registry 6) to the address, 
but it always writes 8 bytes!
as far as I know, a registry only has 4 bytes..
In this case, the registry has the value of the sti-statement inside of it,
as well as the zjmp-statement after it. 
They're all inside one label, and is exactly 8 bytes long.

Could it be that the registry has stored the value of the label itself,
rather than the 4 bytes that stand at the address of that label?(LOOK BELOW)


Label in this case:
	label13: sti   r6,r2,r3           		# 5,225,56
		zjmp  %395 
sti- and zjmp- statements in this case: 
	sti   r6,r2,r3 = 0b 54 06 02 03
	zjmp  %395 = 09 01 8b

Here the registry get's it's value from ldi:
	ldi   r2,%:label13,r6 = 0a 64 02 00 12 06
(meaning 0x12 = 18 - so the address to read from is 18 bytes forward)
